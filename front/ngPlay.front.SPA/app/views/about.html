    <h3>Hosting</h3>
    This project is hosted on 3 Azure nodes
    <ul>
        <li>Azure SQL (ngPlay-data)</li>
        <li>Azure Website (ngPlay-webapi)</li>
        <li>Azure Website (ngPlay-spa)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Features</h3>
    <h4>Echo</h4>
    <p>
        This was the first feature built and allowed for the creation of a thin vertical slice through all
        major layers.
    </p>
    <p>When invoked a call is made to the WebAPI, which logs it to the database and returns the call.</p>

    <h4>Register / Login</h4>
    <p>
        This was the second feature implemented. It built upon the WebAPI Visual Studio project out-of-the-box
        functionality for registering and authenticating users. A custom ASP.NET Identity implementation was required
        to interface with PetaPoco.
    </p>
    <p>Once a user has registered and logged in they are able to access restricted sections of the site.</p>

    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <p>
        This highly unimaginative feature was implemented third. Once a user has logged in they can Create,
        Retrieve, Update and Delete simple notes. The WebAPI controller restricts access to authenticated users.
    </p>
